// Problem Description
// Given a set of N Countries which are numbered from 1 to N, split the Countries into two groups, of any size, such that the following condition is met.

// If a Country dislikes another Country, they should not be in the same group. If dislikes[i] = [a, b], we should not put Country numbered a and Country numbered b into the same group.

// Print out if this kind of partitioning is possible or not.

// Input format
// First line contains a single integer T, which is the number of test cases.

// For each test case, weâ€™ll see the following lines:

// First line contains two space separated integers N and M, where N denotes the number of countries in the list and M denotes the number of dislikes between countries.

// Next M lines contain two space separated integers each, which denote the country numbers that dislike each other. Countries are numbered from 1 to N.

// Output format
// For each test case, output in a new line, "Possible" without quotes if and only if it is possible to split every Country into the two groups, otherwise print "Not Possible" without quotes.

// Constraints
// 1 <= T <= 1000

// 0 <= N <= 100000

// 0 <= M <= min((N*(N-1))/2,100000)

// Sample Input 1
// 1

// 5 4

// 2 1

// 1 3

// 4 2

// 2 5

// Sample Output 1
// Possible

// The partitioning that works is this {1,4,5} and {2,3}

// Sample Input 2
// 1

// 3 3

// 2 1

// 1 3

// 2 3

// Sample Output 2
// Not Possible

// Explanation 2
// It is not possible to partition these three countries into two groups according to the condition.
