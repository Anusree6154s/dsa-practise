### Overview
- [Striver's A2Z sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)
- Coding in cpp:
  - To run code install coderunner and press `ctrl+alt+N`
  - Set `"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Command Prompt"` in settings.json in vscode

### Coding practise steps:

- code yourself
  - First code by yourself + calculate complexities
  - find logic with better complexity
  - find other possible ways in which the same question can be solved
- verify
  - check if your answers include the provided solution. if no, understand the soltuion
  - find different ways of solving from gpt
  - discuss the best few ways of solving with gpt
    > document everything for that question. maintain a practise sheet per question
