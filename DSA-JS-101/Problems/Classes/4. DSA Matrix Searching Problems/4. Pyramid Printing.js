// Problem Description
// Given a number n, you have to print a triangle-shaped pattern with n rows using *. The starting row will have one * and will increment by one for each row after it ( two *s in the second row, three *s in the third row, and so on till the nth row). For eg. if n = 4 pattern will be:

// image

// Input format
// First line contains an integer n - Number of rows.

// Output format
// Return an array of strings with each element in the array representing a row of the pattern.

// Sample Input 1
// 4

// Sample Output 1
// image

// Explanation
// In the first row, there is 1 '*' character.
// In the second row, there are 2 '*' characters separated by space.
// In the third row, there are 3 '*' characters separated by space.
// In the fourth row, there are 4 '*' characters separated by space
// So, the pattern forms a triangle shape where each row has an increasing number of '*' characters, starting from 1 in the first row and incrementing by 1 in each subsequent row until reaching 4 in the fourth row, which corresponds to the value of n.

// Constraints
// 0 < n < 100

//tc=n^2, sc=n^2 because result has n*n time of elements
function patternPrintingI(n) {
    let result = []

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            ans += '*' + " "
        }
        result.push(ans)
        ans = ""
    }


    return result

}

let n = 4
let arr = patternPrintingI(n);
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i])
